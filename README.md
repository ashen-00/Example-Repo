# Welcome to the Code Review Example Repo!
This repo is designed to demonstrate some of the things that you read about in the Code Reviews handout. 

# What to do as a reviewer
1. <b>Your \#1 job is to help your teammates create the best possible code</b> It is a collaborate effort where you work together. 
2. <b>Remember the human</b> When you ask questions or offer advice, try to be constructive. Approach potential mistakes by trying to understand the intentions behind the code. Lead with curiosity, not blame. Asking a question gives the author a chance to process their own code and learn why it was incorrect on their own. 
  For example, rather than "This is bad code." a better comment would be "It's best practice to..." 
3. <b>Offer to help</b> If you give feedback, it can be helpful to include psuedo code or invite them to a brainstorming session to explain potential changes.

# What to do as an author
1. <b>Help others help yourself</b> Make sure that you provide adequate descriptions on your pull requests so that reviewers can understand what you're trying to accomplish. Remember that you're the expert of your code and help your reviewers understand the context of your PR. 
2. <b>Be open to feedback</b> Remember that feedback is a positive collaboration between you and your reviewer! Take feedback as an opportunity to learn something new. 
3. <b>Say thanks</b> Make sure to thank your reviewers for taking the time to look at your code, and maybe even teaching you something new. 

# Tips
1. <b>Use PR templates</b> Pull request templates can make your PRs easier to understand and help you format your descriptions in a consistent way. https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository
2. <b>Use PRs as a way to give positive feedback as well!</b> If someone has a great solution, or an especially readable variable name for a complex idea, or anything else that you appreciated, be sure to let them know!
